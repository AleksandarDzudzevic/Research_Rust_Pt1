## Rust Research Project 1


This repository is my personal journey into learning Rust through an interesting tile game-solving project, aimed at mastering Rust’s core principles like memory safety, concurrency, and performance optimization. Through this project, I explore Rust’s unique ownership model, error handling, and system-level programming features. It’s a hands-on way to understand Rust’s syntax and concepts, and I welcome any suggestions or contributions!
